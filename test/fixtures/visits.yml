# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one:
  title: visita1
  pet: one
# column: value
#
two:
  title: visita2
  pet: two
#  column: value
